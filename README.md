Welcome to the Rembrandt Project!
=====================================

Researchers can use REMBRANDT data-aggregation, query, analysis, and visualization features to uncover critical 
correlations among diverse types of data. The High-order Analysis tab offers three main options for data 
analysis: class comparison, principal component,and hierarchical clustering. REMBRANDT also integrates with
[GenePattern] (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/GenePattern).

The Rembrandt is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
