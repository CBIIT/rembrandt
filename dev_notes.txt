    JDK 1.5.0.2 is now required
    Ant 1.6.5 is the version that I am using  but 1.6.2 should work as well.
   
A. Recommended way to run the build script in Eclipse (for myEclipse see part C) you can use the following steps:
    0.1 make sure you have the correct JDK installed
    0.2 make sure that you have Ant installed
    0.3 make sure that you have JBoss 4.0.2 installed

    1- Check out the project.  
    2- Verify your build path is correct by adding the libraries that are in the not_deployed_jars folder and the WebRoot/WEB-INF/lib folder
    3- Verify the build.properties logging directory is correct for your machine
    4- Check any other properties that are of interest to you
    5- right click on the build.xml file
    6- select "Run As"-->"Ant Build"
    7- Console Output should provide instructions as to what is happening
    8- Grab the war that was placed in your project and put it in the JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/


B. Recommended way to build from command line
    0.1 make sure you have the correct JDK installed
    0.2 make sure that you have Ant installed
    0.3 make sure that you have JBoss 4.0.2 installed

    1- Check out the project.  
    2- Verify the build.properties logging directory is correct for your machine
    3- Check any other properties that are of interest to you
    4- go to the location of the build.xml file and type "Ant"
    5-You should see the project compiling and war'ing
    6- Grab the war that was created and put it in the JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/  

C. Recommended way to build the project in myEclipse (enabling debugging and other features)
    
    0.1 make sure you have the correct JDK installed
    0.2 make sure that you have Ant installed
    0.3 make sure that you have JBoss 4.0.2 installed
    0.4 create a JBOSS_HOME variable in eclipse pointing to the JBoss installation

   I am verifying that it is simply a matter of checking out and importing as a myEclipse web project.
