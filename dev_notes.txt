    JDK 1.5.0.2 is now required
    Ant 1.6.5 is the version that I am using  but 1.6.2 should work as well.

A. Recommended way to check out and build the project in MyEclipse 
(enabling debugging and other features)
    
   	0.1  You must have the cbiocvs2.nci.nih.gov repository mapped
     in the CVS browser
	0.2  You must have JDK 1.5.0_04
	0.3  You must have myEclipse installed
	0.4  You must have JBoss 4.0.2 installed
	0.5  You must have a JBOSS_HOME enviornment variable created in Eclipse
	     that points to your JBoss directory
	0.6  You must have configured JBoss 4 in the 
		Window-->Preferences-->MyEclipse-->Application Servers menu 
	
	**********************************************
	1. Using the CVS Repository Explorer browse to:
		:/share/content/cvsroot/caintegrator
	
	2. Right Click--> select "Check out as..."
	
	3. Select "Check out as a project configured using the New Project Wizard"
	
	4. click "Finish"
	
	5. browse to and select a "MyEclipse/J2EE Projects/Web Project"
	
	6. For the page titled "New J2EE Web Project" use the 
	following settings:
		
		Project Name = "rembrandt"
		
		"Use Default Location" is checked
			
		Source folder = "src"
		
		Web root folder = "WebRoot"
		
		"J2EE Specification Level"
			select "J2EE 1.4[default]"
		
		Leave "JSTL Support" Unchecked
	
	7. click "Finish"
	
	8. Project should begin checking out from CVS
	
	9. Make sure that Project-->"build automatically" is checked
	
	10. Project should build with no errors
	
	**********************************************
	Configure Logging and Database properties
	by modifying the build.properties file and 
	running the build.xml-->configure_database target
	(This will apply your build.property file settings
	to the log4j.properties and repository_database.xml 
	files).  
	**********************************************
	
	11. Create a deployment by going to the toolbar icon with the label
	"Deploy MyEclipse J2EE Project to Server"
	
	12. Select "rembrandt" as the project
	
	13. Press the "Add" button
	
	14. On the next page select "JBoss 4" as your server and select
	"Exploded Archive"
	
	15. Press "Finish"

B. Recommended way to run the build script in Eclipse (for myEclipse see part A)
   you can use the following steps:
    0.1 make sure you have the correct JDK installed
    0.2 make sure that you have Ant installed
    0.3 make sure that you have JBoss 4.0.2 installed

    1- Check out the project.  
    2- Verify your build path is correct by adding the libraries that are in the not_deployed_jars folder and the WebRoot/WEB-INF/lib folder
    3- Verify the build.properties logging directory is correct for your machine
    4- Check any other properties that are of interest to you
    5- right click on the build.xml file
    6- select "Run As"-->"Ant Build"
    7- Console Output should provide instructions as to what is happening
    8- Grab the war that was placed in your project and put it in the JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Recommended way to build from command line
    0.1 make sure you have the correct JDK installed
    0.2 make sure that you have Ant installed
    0.3 make sure that you have JBoss 4.0.2 installed

    1- Check out the project.  
    2- Verify the build.properties logging directory is correct for your machine
    3- Check any other properties that are of interest to you
    4- go to the location of the build.xml file and type "Ant"
    5-You should see the project compiling and war'ing
    6- Grab the war that was created and put it in the JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/
