 =====================================================================
 
    Rembrandt 
    =====================
     
     REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa (REMBRANDT) is a 
     robust bioinformatics knowledgebase framework that leverages 
     data warehousing technology to host and integrate clinical and 
     functional genomics data from clinical trials involving patients 
     suffering from Gliomas. The knowledge framework will provide 
     researchers with the ability to perform ad hoc querying and 
     reporting across multiple data domains, such as 
     Gene Expression, Chromosomal aberrations and Clinical data. 
 
     Scientists will be able to answer basic questions related to 
     a patient or patient population and view the integrated 
     data sets in a variety of contexts. Tools that link data to 
     other annotations such as cellular pathways, gene ontology 
     terms and genomic information are embedded.
 
 
     REMBRANDT is a product of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics
     and its partners, specifically, the Neuro-Oncology branch, 
     CCR (Center for Cancer Research), NCI and NINDS. Visit the 
     REMBRANDT web site for more information:

     webGenome
     =====================

     WebGenome is a web-based application for creating genomics plots of
     array-based data and genomic annotation. Version 2.3 provides a client
     plotting service to external applications, such as Rembrandt. Users must
     enter webGenome through redirection from another application; the only
     way to load data is by selecting it in the referring client application.

     Data types supported in this version include copy number (i.e., aCGH),
     loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and gene expression. Two basic types of plots
     can be generated:

     * Scatter Plots - Plots DNA copy number measurements across the genome,
       chromosome, or chromosomal interval.
     * Ideogram Plot - Shows chromosomal amplifications and deletions in
       relation to cytogenetic chromosome ideograms.

     The underlying data model used by webGenome is a very simplied version of
     the MAGE-OM. The most important concept for the use of the system is
     that individual array data sets, called bioassays are aggregated into experiments.

                            2.0 Features
 =====================================================================
    =====================
    Rembrandt v1.5 Features:
    =====================
     --  F-Test added to Class Comparison: Select the F-test option to test a hypothesis of the means of
         two or more populations, the technique is called the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA
         simplifies the Ftest, where F-test is the mean square for each main effect and the interaction effect
         divided by the within variance. A one-way ANOVA or single factor ANOVA tests differences between the
         groups classified only on one independent variable.

     --  3D PCA applet: The three-dimensional Principal Component Analysis enables you to view PCA plot data 
         in three dimensions. For more information about the PCA plot, see Principal Component Analysis Plot. 
         The applet supports Java Plugin versions 1.4

     --  BRB archieve file download: REMBRANDT enables you to download the BRB archive file and 
         analyze data using BRB-ArrayTools created by the Biometric Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute.
         BRB-ArrayTools is a comprehensive state-of-the-art statistical analysis system for microarray gene
         expression data. It is free for non-commercial purposes and can be licensed for commercial purposes
         from the NIH. BRB-ArrayTools installs as an Excel plug-in using a self-installer.

     --  KEGG Browser: Easily add KEGG pathways to the query by using the KEGG browser to search and 
         identify pathways of interest.

     --  List Management (upload, type, union, intersect, difference, export, validation, saving lists): The 
         REMBRANDT Manage Lists function centralizes all activities pertaining to the creation and management 
         of user-defined, as well as study-defined, PatientDID Lists, Gene Lists, and Reporters Lists. With
         these lists, you can further refine queries or facilitate analysis.

     --  Gene Expression Plot is now dynamically calculated using t-test.

     --  New help documentation: New context sensitive help has been added to each page of the application.

     --  Externalized annotation links: Links for all annotations are now configurable seperately from the 
         web applications.  These properties can be updated independently from the webapp.

     --  Clone IDs now map to LPG IMAGE Clone View (http://lpgws.nci.nih.gov/cgi-bin/iview.cgi)

     --  Box and whisker plot: The Box and Whisker Log2 Intensity Gene Expression Plot (Figure 3.4) displays 
         a box plot without all the individual data points. A box and whisker plot or box plot is a graph
         that presents information from a five-number summary.

     --  Box and whisker-coin plot: A coin plot is box-and-whisker plot with all individual data points. This
         enables you to obtain a diagram representing a statistical summary of the data without the
         disadvantage of concealing the real data.
         
     --  Advanced queries now allow multiple disease selection

     --  Group vs group based KM plot: A K-M Survival Plot for Gene Expression Data displays the survival 
         rate at each time point for samples in 2 compared custom lists of samples.

     --  Group based gene-ex/KM plot: Perform a Gene Expression Simple Search, using a custom patient list
         as a constraint.

     --  Registration/login new pages w/captcha: First-time REMBRANDT users need to register via the 
         web-based form to obtain a username and password.

     --  Feedback form: The feedback questionnaire is an optional form which collects usage data from
         the user on logout.

     --  Re-run advanced queries from view results page (all possible views): All previously completed queries
         will appear in the View Results page, and can be directly ran from this page without going through 
         the Refine Query page again.

     --  Color-less, Shape-less PCA plot: The ability to remove all colors and shapes from a PCA 2-D plot
         has been added to better demonstrate clustering.

     --  New User guide: New PDF user guide has been added for the 1.5 release.  This guide provides
         information on every section of the application.

     --  New Tutorials: Updated Flash tutorials are available which highlight some of the new features
         in 1.5.

     --  Externalized cache: User cache (persisted session data) is now stored in an external location, 
         independent from the web-app.

     --  HTTPS: REMBRANDT now uses HTTPS for enhanced security.

     -- Plotting parameters changes are made in a context
        sensitive popup window available from the plotting page.
        Only those parameters that apply to the plot type are
        provided.
        
     -- Users can change the display name of uploaded experiments and
        bioassays in the workspace.
        
     -- Users can set the color of bioassays in the workspace.
     
     -- Plots now use PNG (portable network graphics) instead of
        SVG (scalable vector graphics).
        
     -- New analytic operations have been added including minimum common
        altered region and aCGH based smoothing.
        (See http://www.bioconductor.org/repository/release1.5/package/html/aCGH.html

 =====================================================================
                   3.0 Known Issues/Future considerations
 =====================================================================
     --  WebGenome plots may timeout when number of samples exceeds 200
     
     --  WebGenome plots from "All Genes" Copy Number query does not work.

     --  WebGenome plots interactivity do not function correctly with the
         Safari browser on the Macintosh operating environment. Plots
         can still be generated correctly using Safari, but
         mouse-over and tooltip interaction do not function. This issue
         is primarily caused by Safari's inadequate JavaScript implementation/support.
         To obtain full plot interactivity using the Macintosh OS, users
         are recommended to use the Firefox browser - which
         works correctly.
         
     --  On class comparison page, for t test and wilcoxin test, p-value for the same
         reporters is different when the comparison and baseline groups are swapped.
         P values are the same until E-10 value.
         
     --  On the GeneExpression, Box & Whisker plot, "Mouse over" max and min values are
         maximum and minimum regular (non-outlier) values, they are not the maximum 
         and minimum outlier values.
         
     --  On the three-dimensional Principal Component Analysis applet, the
         button for "copy the data to the clipboard" does not function.
     
     --  Copying and pasting the URL into a new browser from the 
         application while in the middle of a query, generates an error
     
     --  Cytoband drop down list is not in order on create query pages.     
     
     --  In Safari, nothing shows up in the cytoband dropdown list.     
         Workaround: Search base pair position first, then come back and
         search cytoband again
    
     --  Currently no scientific validation of the cytoband and base
         pair positions of a chromosome.  User has to go look for the
         correct map location in the NCBI map viewer and then select the
         cytoband of interest
              
     --  User cannot get pathway information and GO ID's in generated
         reports, but can see them in the excel downloads from reports
