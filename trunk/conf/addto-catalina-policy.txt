The tomcat policy file is located under the name catalina.policy, 
    which is found in the conf directory of your Tomcat 
    installation. Scroll through the file until you find the 
    following:

          // ========== WEB APPLICATION PERMISSIONS ====
    
    A few lines below, you should see the following:

          grant { 

    (Please note that this does not say "grant codeBase".) 
    Scroll down until you see the close of the grant section:

          };

    At the end of the grant section, modify the section 
    below to match your system's configuration, and copy and 
    paste the information into catalina.policy (below the 
    close of the grant section). 

          grant {
