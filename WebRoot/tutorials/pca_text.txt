You may select samples and save them as a sample group for use throughout the application.  Select samples by using the "lasso" to draw a box around the desired samples.  After selection, your samples will appear in the box to the right of the plot.  You may continue to select samples off of this plot, or one of the other views, before saving your group.  If you mouseover your selected samples, you will see additional information about that sample.
