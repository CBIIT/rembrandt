(*) - indicates resources that are under version control; subdirectories are automatically
included unless otherwise specified

(+) - indicates that the directory/file is required.  The distrib directory should contain the
'deployment unit,' which is every resource your application needs to deploy successfully in the
target environment (hopefully, a single archive), plus any configuration files (conf directory)
that are not contained within the archive, plus detailed deployment instructions, readme files,
release notes, etc., in the readme directory.

(!) - as an alternative, both src-gen and build-gen can be included under a tmp folder, which can
also be used for work in progress.

| Deployment Unit (DU) |
+----------------------+

For the purposes of the SCM initiative, a deployment unit will be defined as all the files
necessary to successfully deploy your application in its target environment, including all
configuration files, deployment instructions, readme's, release notes, and any other files.
